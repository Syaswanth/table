            Electricity is the best gift of science to mankind. This is the age of electricity. Electricity is a source of light, heat, and other comforts. Right from house lighting to the running of giant factories to streets and parks, it is the invisible current that makes these entities run. Electricity supplies all types of energy to man in order to improve his scientific inventions and increase his social amenities.  Heating and cooling processes are also executed by it. All you need to do is just switch on a button and there you have ample power.


Electricity is primarily produced from coal and water. It is also produced from other sources like nuclear energy, solar energy, etc. but still, production is very less. Efforts are being made to produce more electricity from solar, wind, and nuclear sources so that the natural sources can be conserved.
