        1.0 INTRODUCTION
The following report outlines the hardware and software specifications for a prospective computer system designed to give any small business the ability to automate their daily activities. Two key factors are always kept in mind, efficiency at an affordable cost. Even though more powerful specifications can be given this would increase the overall cost of the system. Another thought that was taken into consideration is the ability of the computer system to be upgraded so that the system can give the company at least five years service. The report is organized into sections. The first gives the hardware specifications with a brief description. A breakdown of the software specifications is given next followed by operating systems and typical office application software alternatives.

2.0 COMPUTER HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS 3.1 Processor:Intel Core i3 duo-core processor @3.3GHz, 3MB full speed L2 cache.
This processor is fast enough (3.3 GHz means 3,300,000,000 instructions executed per second) and allows programs that are designed to use two processor cores to take advantage of its duo core design. 3 MB full speed L2 Cache is an added bonus because it allows the processor to operate more efficiently by immediately accessing data and instructions that are needed frequently. This memory is integrated into the CPU chip and is faster than RAM and operates at the same speed (full speed) of the processor. 3.2 Main Memory:8GB DDR3-1333MHz SDRAM
8 Gigabytes is more than sufficient storage space for the Operating System, background programs and applications that are currently used by the processor. DDR3-1333 MHz is the speed at which RAM operates, which is currently the fastest on the market. This is recommended to allow multiple programs to run at the same time without system performance degradation. 3.3 Secondary Storage:
(i) 500GB
